## Economics Rationale for Regulation :memo:
  :notebook:*掌握需要经济监管的 4个原因*

### Information frictions
  - Lack of access to information and inadequete information
  - Asymmetrical information
    > eg: 消费者和厂商之间信息不对称 --> 设置监管保证商品质量(eg:食品质检贴绿色标签)\\
    > $~~~~$ dissemination of information $\uparrow$

### Externalities: 
  - Positive externality
    > eg：Home improvement --> benefits those living nearby
  - Negative externality
    > eg: 污水排放，污染环境

### Weak Competition
  $\Rightarrow$ Dominant firms has significant market power / Firms collude and agree to keep prices high\\
  $\Rightarrow$ High price, less choice, lack of innovation\\
  $\Rightarrow$ Detrimental to consumers
  > 寡头垄断公司定价权高，对老百姓不友好 --> 市场干预

### Social Objectives
  为了实现社会目标实施监管，achieved by 2 ways:
  - Provision of public goods by government (typical)
  > eg: defence, police protection, education
  - Placing regulatory obligations on firms

## Regulators and Regulatory Tools

 ||Regulations | Regulators | 
:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:
立法|Statutes| legislative bodies | 国会
行政|Administrative regulations<br>or administrative law|independent regulators | not government agencies, <br>**not funded** by government<br>eg: 美联储
|||government agencies|**funded** by government
司法|Judical law| Courts | 最高法院 

## Classification of regulators :memo:
- **Regulators**:
  - legislative bodies
  - government agencies
  - independent regulators
  - courts

  > government agencies Vs. independent agencies\\
  > 相同：Both have legal authority to enact and enforce regulations.\\
  > 区别：Independent agencies are not government agencies, and are not funded by government.

- **Industry self-regulatory bodies**:
  > 特征：independent of the government; derive authority from their member; does not have force of law
  - self-regulating organizations (SROs)\\
    - given recognition and authority --> enforcement power
    - SROs are funded independently

    > SRO得到政府授权后，有权监管制度执行，但无权制订制度\\
    > eg：Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) authorized by US SEC to enforce industry rules and federal securities laws
  
  - Non-self regulating organizations

- **Outside bodies**
  - standard-setting bodies
  - no enforcement power

  > 编外人士本身不具有监管权，但是制订了制度\\
  > eg： accounting standard–setting bodies, such as the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and credit-rating agencies
