# SSH Key

The SSH protocol provides this security and allows you to authenticate to the
GitLab remote server without supplying your username or password each time.

## Generate a new ED25519 SSH key
- Type the following command in **Git Bash** to generate a ED25519 SSH Key

  `ssh-keygen -t -ed25519 -C "< email.address >"`

- You will see a similar response:
```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
```
```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```
```
Your identificationhas been saved in /c/Users/xym11/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/xym11/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is: <>
The key's randomart image is: <>
```
Now your SSH Key has been generated and saved.

- If you want to update passphrase, use the following command:

  `ssh-keygen -p -f /path/to/ssh_key`

## Add an SSH key to GitLab account
- Copy public key using the following command:

  `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip`

- Go to GitLab Setting and add the SSH Key (simply paste the public key)

# Git

- A version control system

# Conda

- Conda is a powerful package manager and environment manager
- Use with command line commands at the Anaconda Prompt for Windows (or in a Terminal window for macOS or Linux)

## Managing packages

- Check whether a package (eg. beautifulsoup4) is available from the Anaconda repository (must be connected to the Internat)

  `conda search beautifulsoup4`

- Install a package into the current environment

  `conda install beautifulsoup`

- Check to see if the newly installed program is in this environment

  `conda list`

## Manage environment

- Create a environment

  To create a virtual environment in which all python programs you need are installed:

  `conda env create -f environment.yml`

- Activate and deactivate environment

  `conda activate <env name>`

  `conda deactivate <env name>`

- Check all environment available

  `conda info --envs`

## Add conda environment to jupyter notebook

- Create a conda environment and activate the env

  `conda create --name firstEnv`

  `conda activate firstEnv`

  Then you can install any package you need in this environment

- Install ipykernal
  
  `conda install -c anaconda ipykernel`

- Add the environment to jupyter notebook

  `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=firstEnv`
