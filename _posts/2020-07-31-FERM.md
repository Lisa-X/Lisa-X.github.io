## The Forward Equations

### Elementary Security Price
- $P^e_{i,j}$ denotes the time 0 price of a security that pays \$1 at time $i$, state $j$ and 0 at every other time and state
- Call such a security and **elementary security** and $P^e_{i,j}$ is its state price.
- Elementary security prices satisty the **forward equations**

    $P^e_{k+1,s} = \frac{P^e_{k,s-1}}{2(1 + r_{k,s-1})} + \frac{P^e_{k,s}}{2(1 + r_{k,s})}$

    $P^e_{k+1,0} = \frac{P^e_{k,0}}{2(1 + r_{k,0})}$

    $P^e_{k+1,k+1} = \frac{P^e_{k,k}}{2(1 + r_{k,k})}$

    with $P^e_{0,0} = 1$.
